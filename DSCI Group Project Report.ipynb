There are many variables which do not use numerical values as well, such as the individual's career or field of study. Using 195 predictors would also be very computationally expensive, so we narrowed our possible predictors down to 6: attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, funniness, and ambition. We chose these variables because they can be numerically rated, and are commonly discussed traits regarding relationships, and therefore would be variables to use to predict whether an individual would match with their partner or not. In step 6, we will further narrow down our predictors, by figuring out which variables have the highest correlation with whether or not the individual matches. "
